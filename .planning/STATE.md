# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-02)

**Core value:** No accepted event is ever silently lost — once acknowledged (HTTP 202), an event is durably queued and processed at-least-once and idempotently, surviving worker crashes, DB outages, and flaky downstream APIs, with a DLQ as the final safety net.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Local Infra

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation & Local Infra)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-02 — Roadmap created; all 33 v1 requirements mapped across 6 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: `UNIQUE(fingerprint)` constraint lives in Phase 1 schema — must not be retrofitted later (PITFALLS #2/#3)
- Roadmap: Dynamic routing (RTE-01/02) merged into Phase 4 alongside resilience — worker architecture is shared; avoids a thin standalone phase
- Roadmap: OPS-02 (docker-compose local dev) assigned to Phase 1 — local infra is foundational; OPS-01 (CI) and OPS-03/04 (deployment + demo script) to Phase 6
- Roadmap: Hosting decision (always-on worker free-tier) remains deferred to Phase 6 per research recommendation; Render/Fly candidates known

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] Measure Upstash Redis command count under load to validate free-tier viability before committing to it (research flag from SUMMARY.md)
- [Phase 4] Confirm opossum v9 current API shape (`circuitBreaker()` constructor vs `Policy` wrapper) before implementation
- [Phase 6] Final always-on worker hosting choice (Render background worker vs Fly.io) needs real testing against free-tier keep-alive constraints
